# Visual Feedback In A Laptop Instrument

Final project for Psychology of Music with Professor Mary Farbood at NYU Music Technology. This experiment tested the hypothesis that, *in a video camera controlled software instrument, the presentation of visual feedback will aid in the user's understanding of musical mappings to visual space.* The motion sensing and "visual feedback" was based off of a system similar to that used in [Mirror Music](https://github.com/mdquigley/mirror-music).
