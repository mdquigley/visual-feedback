# Visual Feedback In A Laptop Instrument

Final project for Psychology of Music with Professor Mary Farbood at NYU Music Technology. This experiment tested the hypothesis that, in a video camera controlled software instrument, the presentation of visual feedback will aid in the user's understanding of musical mappings to visual space. The "visual feedback" was based off of a system similar to that used in [Mirror Music](https://github.com/mdquigley/mdquigley.github.io/tree/master/portfolio/mirror-music_src) and the completed project acted as the preliminary research stage of my masters thesis.
